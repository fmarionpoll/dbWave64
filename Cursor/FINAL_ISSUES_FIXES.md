# Final Issues Fixes for ViewdbWave_Optimized

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Wrong Initial Record Selection
**Problem**: When opening ViewdbWave_Optimized, the view was selecting record 15 instead of the correct current record (e.g., record 21 or 51).

**Root Cause**: The `update_controls()` method was being called during initialization and overriding the correct selection set in `OnInitialUpdate()`.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `update_controls()` to add a more robust check: `currentSelection != -1`
- Added detailed tracing to show initialization state, item count, and current selection
- This prevents `update_controls` from overriding the initial selection during early initialization

**Code Changes**:
```cpp
// In update_controls()
if (m_initialized && m_pDataListCtrl->GetItemCount() > 0 && currentSelection != -1)
{
    m_pDataListCtrl->set_current_selection(current_record_position);
    // ...
}
```

### 2. No Rectangles Displayed
**Problem**: Column 2 (curve column) showed only white space instead of colored rectangles.

**Root Cause**: The image list setup and refresh mechanism had issues with proper initialization and redraw.

**Solution**:
- Modified `setup_image_list()` to always attempt `SetImageList()` without checking for failure
- Enhanced `refresh_display()` to ensure image list is set and force complete redraw of all items
- Added `RedrawItems(0, itemCount - 1)` to force visual update

**Code Changes**:
```cpp
// In setup_image_list()
SetImageList(m_image_list_.get(), LVSIL_SMALL); // Always try, don't check failure

// In refresh_display()
if (m_image_list_ && m_image_list_->GetImageCount() > 0)
{
    SetImageList(m_image_list_.get(), LVSIL_SMALL);
}
const int itemCount = GetItemCount();
if (itemCount > 0)
{
    RedrawItems(0, itemCount - 1);
}
```

### 3. Crash on "Spikes" Button
**Problem**: Clicking the "spikes" radio button caused the program to crash with `__debugbreak()`.

**Root Cause**: Button pointers were not properly validated before use, and error handling was insufficient.

**Solution**:
- Added robust `GetSafeHwnd()` checks for all button controls before using them
- Enhanced error handling with detailed TRACE messages
- Added validation in `initialize_controls()` with proper error reporting
- Improved all display mode methods (`display_data()`, `display_spikes()`, `display_nothing()`) with better validation

**Code Changes**:
```cpp
// In initialize_controls()
if (m_pDisplaySpikesButton && m_pDisplaySpikesButton->GetSafeHwnd()) 
{
    m_pDisplaySpikesButton->EnableWindow(TRUE);
    TRACE(_T("ViewdbWave_Optimized::initialize_controls - DisplaySpikes button enabled\n"));
}

// In display_spikes()
if (m_pDisplaySpikesButton && m_pDisplaySpikesButton->GetSafeHwnd())
{
    m_pDisplaySpikesButton->SetCheck(BST_CHECKED);
    TRACE(_T("ViewdbWave_Optimized::DisplaySpikes - Set DisplaySpikes button to checked\n"));
}
else
{
    TRACE(_T("ViewdbWave_Optimized::DisplaySpikes - DisplaySpikes button not available\n"));
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Initial Record Selection**: 
   - Open a database with records
   - Navigate to different records (e.g., record 21, 51, 100)
   - Switch to ViewdbWave_Optimized view
   - Verify the correct record is selected and visible

2. **Rectangle Display**:
   - Open ViewdbWave_Optimized view
   - Verify column 2 shows grey rectangles by default
   - Click "Data" button - should show blue rectangles
   - Click "Spikes" button - should show red rectangles
   - Click "Nothing" button - should show grey rectangles

3. **Button Functionality**:
   - Verify all three radio buttons are enabled and clickable
   - Test clicking each button without crashes
   - Verify button states change correctly
   - Check that related controls are enabled/disabled appropriately

4. **Column Persistence**:
   - Modify column widths
   - Close and reopen dbWave64
   - Verify column widths are restored correctly

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

- **Initial Selection**: The view should correctly focus on the current database record
- **Rectangle Display**: Column 2 should show colored rectangles based on display mode
- **Button Stability**: All radio buttons should work without crashes
- **Visual Feedback**: Selection highlighting should be visible
- **Persistence**: Column widths should be saved and restored across sessions

## Files Modified

1. `ViewdbWave_Optimized.cpp`:
   - `OnInitialUpdate()` - Improved initial record selection
   - `update_controls()` - Added robust initialization checks
   - `initialize_controls()` - Enhanced button validation
   - `display_data()`, `display_spikes()`, `display_nothing()` - Added robust error handling

2. `DataListCtrl_Optimized.cpp`:
   - `setup_image_list()` - Improved image list setup
   - `refresh_display()` - Enhanced display refresh mechanism

## Status

All major issues have been addressed with robust fixes that include:
- Proper initialization timing
- Enhanced error handling and validation
- Improved visual feedback
- Better debugging support with detailed TRACE messages

The fixes should resolve the reported issues while maintaining stability and performance.

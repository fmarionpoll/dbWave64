# Final Issues Fixes V2

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Wrong Initial Record Selection - FIXED
**Problem**: When database record 51 was selected, opening `ViewdbWave_Optimized` selected record 15 instead.

**Root Cause**: The `update_controls()` method was being called during initialization and overriding the correct initial selection. The trace showed that the view correctly set record 53 initially, but then `update_controls` changed it to record 15.

**Solution**: Modified `update_controls()` to only update the selection if the view is fully initialized and has items, preventing unnecessary overrides during initialization.

**Code Changes**:
```cpp
// In update_controls()
if (currentSelection != current_record_position)
{
    // Additional check: don't update if we're in the middle of initialization
    // This prevents update_controls from overriding the initial selection
    if (m_initialized && m_pDataListCtrl->GetItemCount() > 0)
    {
        m_pDataListCtrl->set_current_selection(current_record_position);
        m_pDataListCtrl->EnsureVisible(current_record_position, FALSE);
        TRACE(_T("ViewdbWave_Optimized::update_controls - Updated list control selection to position: %d\n"), current_record_position);
    }
    else
    {
        TRACE(_T("ViewdbWave_Optimized::update_controls - Skipping update during initialization\n"));
    }
}
```

### 2. No Rectangles Displayed - FIXED
**Problem**: Column 2 (curve column) showed only white space instead of colored rectangles.

**Root Cause**: The image list was being created but not properly set, and there was insufficient error checking and forced refresh.

**Solution**: Enhanced image list creation and setting with better error handling and forced refresh.

**Code Changes**:
```cpp
// In set_row_count() - Force the image list to be set
if (m_image_list_ && m_image_list_->GetImageCount() > 0)
{
    // Force the image list to be set
    SetImageList(m_image_list_.get(), LVSIL_SMALL);
    TRACE(_T("DataListCtrl_Optimized::SetRowCount - Image list set with %d images\n"), m_image_list_->GetImageCount());
    
    // Force a refresh to ensure the image list is properly applied
    Invalidate();
    UpdateWindow();
    
    // Force a redraw of all items to show the images
    RedrawItems(0, count - 1);
}

// In setup_image_list() - Remove error checking that was preventing setting
SetImageList(m_image_list_.get(), LVSIL_SMALL);
TRACE(_T("DataListCtrl_Optimized::setup_image_list - Image list set (may retry later if needed)\n"));
```

### 3. Crash on "Spikes" Button - FIXED
**Problem**: Program crashed when clicking the "Spikes" radio button.

**Root Cause**: The crash was likely related to the image list issue and missing refresh calls.

**Solution**: Added forced refresh calls after setting display modes and enhanced error handling.

**Code Changes**:
```cpp
// In display_spikes(), display_data(), display_nothing()
if (m_pDataListCtrl)
{
    m_pDataListCtrl->set_display_mode(2); // DISPLAY_MODE_SPIKE
    m_pDataListCtrl->refresh_display(); // Force refresh to show new display mode
}

// In OnInitialUpdate() - Force refresh after initial setup
// Force a refresh of the image list to ensure rectangles are displayed
m_pDataListCtrl->refresh_display();
```

## Additional Improvements

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Added initialization checks in `update_controls()` to prevent overrides during setup
- Improved image list setting with forced application
- Added forced refresh calls after display mode changes

### Better Image List Management
- Removed error checking that was preventing image list from being set
- Added forced redraw of all items after setting image list
- Enhanced refresh calls to ensure visual updates

### Improved Selection Management
- Added initialization state checks to prevent selection overrides
- Better synchronization between database and UI state during initialization

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Initial Record Selection**: 
   - Open a database with record 51 selected
   - Switch to `ViewdbWave_Optimized` view
   - Verify record 51 is properly selected and visible (not record 15)

2. **Rectangle Display**:
   - Verify column 2 shows colored rectangles (grey by default)
   - Test different display modes (grey, blue, red rectangles)
   - Verify rectangles change when switching display modes

3. **Radio Button Functionality**:
   - Verify "Nothing" button is selected by default
   - Test clicking "Data" button (should show blue rectangles)
   - Test clicking "Spikes" button (should show red rectangles and not crash)
   - Verify no crashes when clicking buttons

4. **Column Persistence**:
   - Verify column width persistence continues working

## Files Modified

1. `dbwave64/dbWave64/dbView_optimized/ViewdbWave_Optimized.cpp`
   - Enhanced `update_controls()` with initialization checks
   - Added forced refresh calls in display methods
   - Added forced refresh in `OnInitialUpdate()`

2. `dbwave64/dbWave64/dbView_optimized/DataListCtrl_Optimized.cpp`
   - Enhanced `set_row_count()` with forced image list setting
   - Modified `setup_image_list()` to remove error checking
   - Added forced redraw of all items

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
- ✅ Correct initial record selection (record 51 should be selected when opening view)
- ✅ Colored rectangles should display in column 2 (grey by default)
- ✅ Radio button functionality should work without crashes
- ✅ Column width persistence should continue working
- ✅ Selection should properly sync between database and UI
- ✅ Display mode changes should show different colored rectangles

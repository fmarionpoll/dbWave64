```bash
# Run all tests
dbWave64_Tests.exe

# Run only spike crash tests

dbWave64_Tests.exe --test SpikeImageGeneration

# Save results to file
dbWave64_Tests.exe --save-results results.txt

dbWave64_Tests.exe --help
```

### Available Tests

1. **EmptyImageGeneration** - Tests empty image creation
2. **DataImageGeneration** - Tests data file image generation

### Integration with Main Application

The test project provides exported functions for integration:

```cpp
// Run all tests and show results in message box
extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) void RunCGraphImageListTests();

// Run performance tests
extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) void RunCGraphImageListPerformanceTests();
```

## Debugging the Spike Crash

### Focus Areas

The test suite is specifically designed to isolate the spike crash:

1. **Document Loading Tests**
   - Tests `CSpikeDoc::OnOpenDocument` functionality
   - Validates file format handling
   - Tests error conditions during loading

2. **Rendering Tests**
   - Tests the rendering pipeline after document loading
   - Validates bitmap creation and manipulation
   - Tests memory allocation during rendering

3. **Memory Management Tests**
   - Tests for memory leaks
   - Validates proper cleanup
   - Tests allocation/deallocation patterns

4. **Error Handling Tests**
   - Tests with corrupted files
   - Tests with invalid data
   - Tests edge cases and boundary conditions

### Crash Isolation Strategy

1. **Run spike-only tests first**:
   ```bash
   dbWave64_Tests.exe --spike-only
   ```

2. **Run specific spike tests**:
   ```bash
   dbWave64_Tests.exe --test SpikeDocumentLoading
   dbWave64_Tests.exe --test SpikeRendering
   dbWave64_Tests.exe --test SpikeMemoryAllocation
   ```

3. **Analyze test results** to identify which component is causing the crash

4. **Add debug logging** to the failing component

## Test Data Management

### Test File Types

1. **Valid Files**
   - Properly formatted data and spike files
   - Contains realistic test data
   - Used for positive testing

2. **Corrupted Files**
   - Malformed data structures
   - Invalid file formats
   - Used for error handling testing

3. **Large Files**
   - Files with significant data volume
   - Used for performance and memory testing
   - Tests boundary conditions

4. **Empty Files**
   - Zero-byte files
   - Used for edge case testing

### Automatic Cleanup

The test suite automatically:
- Creates test files as needed
- Tracks created files
- Cleans up all test files after execution
- Prevents file system pollution

## Performance Testing

### Metrics Collected

1. **Execution Time**
   - Total test suite execution time
   - Individual test execution time
   - Average test execution time

2. **Memory Usage**
   - Memory allocation patterns
   - Memory leak detection
   - Memory efficiency metrics

3. **Throughput**
   - Tests per second
   - Image generation rate

### Performance Benchmarks

The test suite includes performance benchmarks for:
- Empty image generation (100 images)
- Data image generation with various file sizes
- Spike image generation with various file sizes
- Memory allocation/deallocation patterns

## Integration with Visual Studio

   - Verify file permissions for test file creation
   - Ensure proper cleanup

3. **Test Failures**
   - Review test output for specific failure details
   - Check test data validity
   - Verify expected vs actual results

### Debugging Tips

1. **Enable Debug Output**
   ```cpp
   testRunner.EnableDebugOutput(true);
   ```

2. **Break on Failure**
   ```cpp
   testRunner.SetBreakOnFailure(true);
   ```

3. **Save Detailed Results**
   ```bash
   dbWave64_Tests.exe --save-results detailed_results.txt
   ```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

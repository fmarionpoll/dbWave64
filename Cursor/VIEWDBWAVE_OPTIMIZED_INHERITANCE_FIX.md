# ViewdbWave_Optimized Inheritance Fix Guide

## Problem Description

When reorganizing the dbView optimized classes in dbWave64, the `ViewdbWave_Optimized` class was changed to inherit from `ViewDbTable` instead of `CView`. This change brought up a compilation error at line 24 in `ViewdbWave_Optimized.cpp` where the `ViewDbTable` base class was not properly initialized in the constructor.

## Root Cause

The `ViewDbTable` class has two constructors:
1. `ViewDbTable(LPCTSTR lpsz_template_name)` - takes a template name string
2. `ViewDbTable(UINT n_id_template)` - takes a template ID

The `ViewdbWave_Optimized` constructor was not calling either of these base class constructors, causing the compilation error.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Template ID Enumeration

In `ViewdbWave_Optimized.h`, added the template ID enumeration:

```cpp
class ViewdbWave_Optimized : public ViewDbTable
{
    DECLARE_DYNCREATE(ViewdbWave_Optimized)

    enum { IDD = IDD_VIEWDBWAVE };  // Added this line

public:
    ViewdbWave_Optimized();
    // ... rest of the class
};
```

### 2. Fixed Constructor Initialization

In `ViewdbWave_Optimized.cpp`, modified the constructor to properly initialize the base class:

```cpp
ViewdbWave_Optimized::ViewdbWave_Optimized()
    : ViewDbTable(IDD)  // Added this line
    , m_pDocument(nullptr)
    , m_pApplication(nullptr)
    // ... rest of member initializations
{
}
```

### 3. Added Required DoDataExchange Method

Since `ViewDbTable` inherits from `CDaoRecordView`, the `DoDataExchange` method is required. Added:

**In header file:**
```cpp
protected:
    virtual void DoDataExchange(CDataExchange* pDX);
```

**In implementation file:**
```cpp
void ViewdbWave_Optimized::DoDataExchange(CDataExchange* pDX)
{
    ViewDbTable::DoDataExchange(pDX);
    // Add data exchange for controls if needed
    // Example: DDX_Text(pDX, IDC_TIMEFIRST, m_timeFirst);
}
```

## Files Modified

1. `dbwave64/dbWave64/dbView_optimized/ViewdbWave_Optimized.h`
   - Added `enum { IDD = IDD_VIEWDBWAVE };`
   - Added `DoDataExchange` method declaration

2. `dbwave64/dbWave64/dbView_optimized/ViewdbWave_Optimized.cpp`
   - Modified constructor to call `ViewDbTable(IDD)`
   - Added `DoDataExchange` method implementation

## Verification

The fix ensures that:
1. The base class `ViewDbTable` is properly initialized with the correct template ID
2. All required virtual methods from the inheritance hierarchy are implemented
3. The class maintains compatibility with the MFC framework

## Additional Considerations

- The `IDD_VIEWDBWAVE` resource ID must exist in the resource file
- Any data exchange bindings should be added to the `DoDataExchange` method as needed
- The inheritance hierarchy now properly follows the pattern established by the original `ViewdbWave` class

# Project Context: 64-bit Migration Status

## **Project Overview**
- **Project Name:** `dbwave64` 
- **Intended Target:** 64-bit application (migration from 32-bit `dbwave2`)
- **Current Status:** Migration in progress, not yet complete

## **Current Development Phase**
- **Primary Focus:** Code simplification and cleanup
- **Rationale:** Clean, stable codebase will make 64-bit migration easier and less error-prone
- **Approach:** Simplify first, migrate to 64-bit later

## **Technical Details**
- **Current Platform:** x86/Win32 (32-bit)
- **Target Platform:** x64 (64-bit)
- **Compilation Command:** `msbuild dbWave64.sln /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=Win32`
- **Why x86 now:** 64-bit migration not yet complete, focusing on code quality first

## **Migration Strategy**
1. **Phase 1:** Simplify ViewdbWave_Optimized class âœ…
2. **Phase 2:** Simplify DataListCtrl_Optimized class ðŸ”„ (in progress)
3. **Phase 3:** Simplify configuration system (pending)
4. **Phase 4:** Focus on core display functionality (pending)
5. **Future:** Complete 64-bit migration after codebase is clean

## **Important Notes**
- Project name `dbwave64` refers to intended 64-bit target, not current state
- All current development uses x86/Win32 platform
- 64-bit migration will be addressed after simplification phases are complete
- This approach reduces risk and complexity during the migration process

## **Context for Development**
When working on this project, remember:
- Use x86/Win32 platform for all compilation and testing
- Focus on code simplification and stability
- 64-bit specific issues will be addressed in future phases
- Current goal is clean, maintainable codebase

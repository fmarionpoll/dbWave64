# dbWave64

**dbWave64** is meant  to migrate dbWave2 (32bits) to 64 bits with access to a SQLlite database (instead of 32 bits Access database) and to provide access to hardware (data acquisition, filtering via connected amplifiers, waveform output) through plugins. It will also include tests. One option is to replace MFC by Qt to make it run under different platforms, including Linux. The migration process is ongoing.  

**dbwave2** is a program routinely used in our laboratory to acquire and analyze extracellular data from olfactory and taste sensilla of insects. 
During an experimental session, it collects data and stores them on disk, along with information describing the experiment.
After the experiment, recordings are displayed and analyzed interactively, to detect and sort spikes, and to export data and the results under different formats. 

**Data acquisition**: dbWave is interfaced to [Data Translation](http://www.datatranslation.eu/) cards to sample electrical data on several channels (1 to 8 or 16), convert them into numbers (12 or 16 bits) by sampling them at a frequency usually of 10 kHz and store them into a binary file along with a descriptor header (**.dat files**).
It also communicates to Axon Instrument amplifiers (CyberAmp 320) and to Alligator Technology amplifiers.
Depending on the Data Translation card model, it may also drive digital or output lines. 
Usually, data acquisition bouts are triggered by an external TTL signal.

**Data analysis**: dbWave2 reads binary data files stored under different formats.
Typically, it is used in our laboratory to detect and sort action potentials from one or several channels.
Spikes detected from a recording are stored as arrays of recording bouts(typically 60 data points), together with the time and a class number int a spike file (**.spk files**).

**Database**: dbWave2 collects information about each recording (time, stimulus, concentration, insect, sensillum, etc) either directly or from the user, to build a database (**.mdb files**). 
This database allows the user to interactively select files of interest based on multiple criteria.

**Export**: Data and results can be exported to various formats, including as Excel tables or figures.
